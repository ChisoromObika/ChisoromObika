## About me 
I love following trails and clues. This curiosity led me down the OSINT path and then the cybersecurity path in that order.  



Whether it’s diving deep into threat intelligence, dissecting malware, or monitoring systems for suspicious activity, I’m all about staying ahead of threats. 
When I’m not hunting down threats, you’ll find me doing 2 things;
1. Sharing insights and tips I gather from security research on my Medium blog.
2. Making OSINT walkthroughs on my medium blog.


## Objective
Now, as a security analyst, I aim to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 MDR Analyst. 
where I can combine my investigative and technical skills to help security teams.
