I love following trails and clues. This curiosity led me down the OSINT and then cybersecurity paths in that order. 



Whether it’s diving deep into threat investigations, dissecting malware, or monitoring systems for suspicious activity, I’m all about staying ahead of the risks posed to a company's brand and its people.  
When I’m not hunting for threats, you’ll find me doing 2 things;
1. Sharing ways companies and people can secure their information on my Medium blog - https://medium.com/@chiobika
2. Participating in OSINT CTFs.


## Objective
Now, as a security analyst, I aim to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 MDR Analyst. 
where I can combine my investigative and technical skills to help security teams.
