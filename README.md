I love following trails and clues. This curiosity led me down the OSINT and then cybersecurity paths in that order. 



Whether it’s diving deep into threat investigations, dissecting malware, or monitoring systems for suspicious activity, I’m all about staying ahead of the risks posed to a company's brand and its people.  
When I’m not hunting for threats, you’ll find me doing 2 things;
1. Sharing ways companies and people can secure their information on my Medium blog - https://medium.com/@chiobika
2. Participating in OSINT CTFs.


## Objective
As a security analyst, I aim to contribute to securing digital assets and digital ecosystems. By looking at a company's publicly available information and assets, I find ways they can tighten their defenses against threat actors.
